# Introduction

Stefamon was a project that I made during the final challenge in the Stefanini Hackaton 2023. <br> <br>
After that, I choose to continue developing the project, adding more functionalities to increase my knowledge with Angular, PrimeNG and JavaEE (Technologies that I use in my job today.)

# Technologies used
## Backend
* Java 11
* Quarkus with Jax-RS (RestEASY) and CDI
* Hibernate
* Maven 3.8.1

## Frontend
* Angular 10
* PrimeNG 10

# Documentation

Backend and Frontend folders contains the instructions to run the application locally. <br> <br>
The project requirements can be seen [here](https://github.com/akaMiike/stefamon/blob/main/backend/desafio/StefaMon.pdf), and aditional instructions can be seen [here](https://github.com/akaMiike/stefamon/blob/main/backend/Instru%C3%A7%C3%B5es.md)
